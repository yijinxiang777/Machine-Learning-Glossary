Recent years have witnessed a tremendous increase in both interest and use of machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) methods in epidemiologic research.[cite a bunch]  Though there are no generally accepted definitions of machine learning or artificial intelligence,[cite Burkov] both tend to focus on or involve identifying relevant patterns in data, or minimizing modeling assumptions.[cite] The fields of ML and AI are immensely complex, and can be implicated in a number of different areas that are relevant to epidemiologic research and practice. These may include predictive analytics, causal inference, automation via specific (versus general) AI, nonparametric (versus parametric) estimation; and supervised, semi-supervised, or unsupervised learning. Because of its increasing popularity, epidemiologists are needing to better understand these fields, their associated complexities, and their relevance or irrelevance to epidemiologic research and practice.   

At present, research on the developments and techniques of machine learning and artificial intelligence are highly technical in nature, and are often difficult for applied epidemiologists and biomedical scientists with little to no training in theoretical or mathematical statistics to access. As a result many advanced techniques in machine learning remain underutilized and/or misunderstood. Furthermore, many of the terms used in ML and AI are also employed in disciplines such as epidemiology, but with slightly or dramatically different meanings.   

The purpose of this paper is to provide an entryway into the complex fields of ML and AI for epidemiologists. Here, we discuss general aspects of the fields of ML and AI relevant to epidemiologists. These include the role and challenges of ML and AI in pattern recognition, prediction, causal discovery, and causal inference. We articulate some of the challenges in the fields of ML and AI, and indicate why they are important to consider when using ML and AI methods in epidemiologic settings. Finally, we provide a glossary of introductory and intermediate terms and concepts to facilitate comprehension, and better integrate ML and AI into epidemiologic research. Importantly, we note that ML and AI methods are not a cure for poor quality data, and emphasize the importance of data integrity, broadly defined, in considering the use of ML and AI techniques in epidemiology.
